Waypoint - By [pirogoeth][origin]
=====

[Waypoint][] is a multipurpose [Bukkit][] plugin for general teleporting, spawn and home management.
This is a personal fork for implement certian things and also gaining ground on learning the Bukkit API and GIT.
I will do pull request on the creators branch as I deem appropriate for implention into the plugin.

First real use of both Github and Bukkit API, so go easy :P
